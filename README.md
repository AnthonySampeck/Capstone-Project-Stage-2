#Udacity-Android-Capstone-Stage-2
This is the second stage of the capstone project for Udacity's Android Nanodegree.   
It lists new movies on Netflix in your favorite category and includes a widget that does the same.  
While waiting for an API key from Netflix, and for demo purposes, I incorporated the JSOUP html parser library to temporarily scrape data from a website that already has a Netflix API key.   
Do not use this app on a regular basis or instantwatcher.com will block your IP address.  
I'm still waiting on Netflix to get back to me with an API key.
